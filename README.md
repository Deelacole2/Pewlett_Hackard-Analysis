# Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis

## Overview/Purpose of the Analysis:
 Our company, Pewlett Hackard, is coming up on a time period where a record number of our employees will begin to retire, the so-called 'Silver Tsunami'. In order to avoid a crisis with so many people leaving at the same time. I was tasked with querying our newly created sql database, to find the answers to the following questions:
 - How many people are retiring?
 - What are the numbers by title?
 - which employees are eligible for the mentorship program?

## Results
1. Retirement Titles csv
2. Unique Titles csv
3. Retiring Titles csv
4. Mentorship Eligibility csv

## Summary:  Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

  * How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
